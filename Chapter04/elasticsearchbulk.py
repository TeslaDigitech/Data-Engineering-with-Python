# This Python code uses the Elasticsearch library to insert 998 documents with randomly generated data into an Elasticsearch index called 'users'. The code follows these steps:

# Import the Elasticsearch library and helpers module
# Import the Faker library for generating fake data
# Create a Faker instance
# Create an Elasticsearch client
# Generate a list of actions (documents) to be inserted into Elasticsearch
# Perform a bulk operation to insert the documents into Elasticsearch
# Print the response from the Elasticsearch bulk operation

# Import the Elasticsearch library
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
# Import the helpers module from the Elasticsearch library
from elasticsearch import helpers
# Import the Faker library for generating fake data
from faker import Faker

# Create a Faker instance
fake = Faker()

# Create an Elasticsearch client, connecting to the default address (localhost) and port (9200)
es = Elasticsearch()

# Generate a list of actions to be performed in bulk by Elasticsearch
actions = [
  {
    "_index": "users",            # Define the index name
    "_type": "doc",               # Define the document type
    "_source": {                  # Define the document source (the data to be inserted)
        "name": fake.name(),      # Generate a random name
        "street": fake.street_address(),  # Generate a random street address
        "city": fake.city(),      # Generate a random city
        "zip": fake.zipcode()     # Generate a random zip code
    }
  }
  for x in range(998)            # Repeat the process for 998 times (creating 998 documents)
]

# Perform a bulk operation using the actions generated above
response = helpers.bulk(es, actions)

# Print the response from the Elasticsearch bulk operation
print(response)
